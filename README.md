# Polynomial Calculator (Android)

This is an Android application built in **Java** using **Android Studio**.
The app provides a simple calculator interface for performing operations on **polynomials**, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. It supports entering variables (`X`) and combines like terms to simplify results.

---

## 📱 Features

* Numeric keypad (0–9) with buttons for:

  * `+` addition
  * `-` subtraction
  * `*` multiplication
  * `/` division
  * `^` exponents
  * `X` variable input
* Clear (`C`) and Delete (⌫) buttons
* Handles polynomial formatting and ordering by degree
* Performs simplification such as:

  * Combining like terms
  * Expanding multiplications
  * Ordering polynomial terms by highest degree first
* Basic error handling (e.g., invalid input, overflow)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Android SDK
* **IDE:** Android Studio
* **UI:** Android XML layouts with `Button` and `TextView`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* JDK 8+

### Running the Project

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/melvinthoompunkal/Polynomial_Calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Let Gradle sync and build the project.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical Android device.

---

## 🧮 Example Usage

* Input:

  ```
  2X^2 + 3X + 4 + X^2
  ```
* Output:

  ```
  3X^2 + 3X + 4
  ```

## 📂 Project Structure

* `MainActivity.java` → Core logic for button handling and calculation
* `res/layout/activity_main.xml` → UI layout with buttons and display
* `res/values/` → Styles, colors, and string resources

---

## 📌 Notes

* This was an **academic / personal project** to practice Android development and polynomial operations.
* The calculator currently supports single-variable polynomials (`X`).

✅ You can paste that directly into a `README.md` file in your repo.

Do you want me to also give you a **shorter version** (like 5–6 lines only) in case you want something minimal on GitHub?
